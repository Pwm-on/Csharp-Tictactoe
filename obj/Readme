Tictactoe is a game where the objective is to make 3 marks (horizontal,vertical, diagonal). First player to
make 3 scores (a 'X' or 'O')wins.
This project was made in C# and consist in a program class and a class named 'board'. 'Board' controls both
games (Player vs Player or Player vs CPU).

Board has all the necessary methods to make work this game, so when the program begins has two options:
1) Player vs Player.
2) Player vs CPU.

Boards control all methods and the difference this option is the ComputerPlaying() method. So choosing to play Player vs Player:
    1) Game begins with 'X' choosing a place. After that, it's 'O'. All even turns are 'X', odds 'O' (to decide which turn is it, it's necessery to make turn mod 2).
    2) In case players choose a place have already been marked, a do-while loop will prevent players to to do this.
    3) And finally, a method ("EndingCondition())
    verifys if one of the players have won.

And choosing Player vs CPU (option 2), the difference is ComputerPlaying() method. This method randomly chooses a place that has not been picked yet.
